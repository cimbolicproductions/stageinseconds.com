      "prompt": "I need to add comprehensive error tracking and logging using FREE tools for production error monitoring.\n\nRequirements:\n\n1. Install Pino logging packages (100% FREE):\n   - pino (fast, low-overhead logger)\n   - pino-pretty (pretty printing for development)\n   - pino-http (HTTP logging middleware for Hono)\n   - @logtail/pino (OPTIONAL: for free log aggregation)\n\n2. Create logger configuration:\n   File: apps/web/src/utils/logger.ts\n   - Create Pino logger instance with structured logging\n   - Different log levels: error, warn, info, debug, trace\n   - Pretty printing in development (pino-pretty)\n   - JSON logging in production (for log aggregation)\n   - Context enrichment: requestId, userId, path, method\n   - Error serialization with stack traces\n   - Optional: Integration with BetterStack/LogTail (free tier: 1GB/month)\n\n3. Integrate Pino in server:\n   File: apps/web/__create/index.ts\n   - Import and initialize Pino logger\n   - Add pino-http middleware for automatic request/response logging\n   - Create error handler middleware that logs all errors\n   - Capture all unhandled exceptions and log them\n   - Add request correlation IDs for tracing\n\n4. Integrate logging in React:\n   File: apps/web/src/entry.client.tsx\n   - Create client-side error logger (console or send to API endpoint)\n   - Add error boundary that logs React errors\n   - Optional: Send critical frontend errors to backend logging endpoint\n\n5. Update API routes to use structured logging:\n   Update all API routes to:\n   - Log errors using logger.error() before returning error response\n   - Include request context (userId, requestId, path, method)\n   - Add custom fields for filtering (apiRoute, statusCode, errorType)\n   - Log important events: user signup, payment success, job creation\n\n6. Update .env.example:\n   - Add LOG_LEVEL (defaults to 'info')\n   - Add LOGTAIL_TOKEN (optional, for free log aggregation)\n   - Document NODE_ENV usage (determines pretty vs JSON logging)\n\n7. Create documentation:\n   File: docs/LOGGING.md\n   - How logging works in this application\n   - Log levels and when to use them (error, warn, info, debug)\n   - How to view logs locally (pino-pretty output)\n   - How to view logs in production (file-based or log aggregation)\n   - Optional: Setting up BetterStack/LogTail (free tier)\n   - Optional: Setting up Papertrail (free tier)\n   - How to search and filter logs\n   - Best practices for logging (what to log, what not to log)\n   - Understanding log context and correlation IDs\n\n8. Update DEPLOYMENT.md:\n   - Add logging section with instructions for viewing logs in production\n   - Document free log aggregation options (BetterStack, Papertrail, file-based)\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- Pino is 100% FREE and one of the fastest Node.js loggers\n- BetterStack/LogTail free tier: 1GB/month (enough for hobby projects)\n- Papertrail free tier: 50MB/day (plenty for small apps)\n- File-based logging is completely free (requires log rotation)\n- Do NOT log passwords, credit cards, or sensitive data\n- Structured logging (JSON) makes it easy to search and filter\n\nLocation: apps/web/",
